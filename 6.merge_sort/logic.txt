Merge sort follows a divide and conquer approach.
Its a recursive algo.

Phases:
------- 
1. Divide the array into 2 halves. 
2. Sort the sub arrays recursively
3. Merge the sorted sub arrays. 

Time complexity: 
2T(n/2) + O(n) --> 2nd case of master method --> )(nlogn) [for best, worst and average case]
