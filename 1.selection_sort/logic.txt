To sort in ascending order: 
    select the 0th index, put the smallest element of the array (0th to last index)
    select the next index, put the smallest element of the rest of the array (1st to last index)
    select the next index, put the smallest element of the rest of the array (2nd to last index)
    Repeat the above steps till the whole array is covered


Time complexity: O(n)
